    <p>Hello Brothers and Sisters. I am from Zimbabwe and I currnetly stay in South Africa with my family. I am married and have two young daughters of 3 years and 8 months. I am a member of the Church for 4 years and currently serving in the Sunday school Presidency in my Ward.</p>
    <p>I curently work in the Hospitality industry as a manager, however, I am planning on a career switch with my studies. I love and enoy working with computers and I am entrigued with the whole back-end processing. Having to be the one who codes that will be one of my humbling experiences. </p>
    <p>I like watching Sci-Fi movies just to see how much the world is evolving to and also because they are mostly Tech based LOL.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning much from this course and earning my Degree.</p>
